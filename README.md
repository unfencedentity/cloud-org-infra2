# cloud-org-infra2

This repository is a step-by-step rebuild of an organizational Azure infrastructure using Terraform.

The goal is to:
- Understand the basics of Azure (tenant, subscription, resource groups, resources).
- Define a data landing zone based on ADLS Gen2 with proper networking and security.
- Use Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) to keep the deployment repeatable and versioned.
- Document the architecture and decisions in a clear, beginner-friendly way.
